[0mCMake Error: install(EXPORT "export_nuturtlebot_msgs__rosidl_generator_py" ...) includes target "nuturtlebot_msgs__rosidl_generator_py" which requires target "nuturtlebot_msgs__rosidl_typesupport_c" that is not in this export set, but in multiple other export sets: share/nuturtlebot_msgs/cmake/nuturtlebot_msgs__rosidl_typesupport_cExport.cmake, share/nuturtlebot_msgs/cmake/nuturtlebot_msgs__rosidl_typesupport_cExport.cmake.
An exported target cannot depend upon another target which is exported multiple times. Consider consolidating the exports of the "nuturtlebot_msgs__rosidl_typesupport_c" target to a single export.[0m
